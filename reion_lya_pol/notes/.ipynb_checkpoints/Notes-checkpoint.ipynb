    "## Lyman-$\\alpha$ Polarization Signal From Reionization Fronts\n",
    "\n",

    "Currently in this notes, we have 4 functions to code up: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **u_front**: calculate the ionizing front velocity\n",
    "- **xH_interp**: do a 3D interpolation for the xH boxes\n",
    "- **front_loc**: identify the location of xH=0.5 cells, which are regarded as the ionizing fronts\n",
    "- **xH_grad**: get the xH gradient value at ionizing fronts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emily and Yuanyuan, pick one or more functions you'd like to build up or play with after reading the notes.** You could write your name after the function you choose above, e.g. u_front (Heyang), or just send a slack messege to let other teammates know. As you may have noticed there are so many pieces in this calculation and we may need to work on communicating more often to make sure we are on the same page and could work more collaborately and efficiently.\n",

    "## General descrition\n",
    "Polarized Lyman-$\\alpha$ signal could be generated by ionizing fronts when Lyman-$\\alpha$ photons were scatterer by HI. Therefore, the power spectrum of Lyman-$\\alpha$ polarization intensity mapping signal at the Epoch of Reionization should have a feature scale which is comparable to the scale of reionization bubbles. As illustrated by Yuanyuan and Emily's first paper, this signal depends on local hydrogen density, the velocity, temperature and orientation of front plane, which could shed light not only on the process of reionization, but also the geometrical information of reionization. In this project we want to extend the results of single-plane parallel inoization front to have a more realistic estimate of signal from reionization fronts. To achive this, we first run 21cmFAST simulations with reionization implemented, then we extract quantities from simulation boxes for the sake of our calculations. Lastly, with the polarization intensity distribution from Yuanyuan and Emily's paper and quantites from 21cmFAST, we could finish the aimed calculation."
