# Lyman-alpha

There are two main parts of this project:

The first part is Lya, which is the model of polarized Lyman-alpha emission from cosmic ionization fronts, giving blackbody temperature, front velocity, neutral hydrogen density, number of photons, it will return a bunch of information. And those information can be calculated to front intensity and polarized intensity via the internal python code.

The second part is 21cm, which will identify the ionization fronts inside the coeval cubes generated by 21cmFAST, calculate the intensity and polarized intensity of each front and generate a power specturm for it.

See each project file for detail.
